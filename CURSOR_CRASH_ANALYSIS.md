# Cursor Crash Analysis Report

## Problem Summary
Cursor experienced a crash loop due to overly aggressive performance optimization scripts that were killing essential Cursor processes, causing the application to constantly restart and eventually crash completely.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Aggressive Optimization Loop
1. **Script**: `aggressive_typing_fix.sh` was running with very aggressive settings
2. **Monitoring Interval**: Every 5-10 seconds (too frequent)
3. **CPU Threshold**: 5% CPU usage (too low - normal Cursor processes use more)
4. **Process Killing**: Killing processes that Cursor immediately restarts

### Evidence from Performance Log
```
[2025-07-18 18:25:54] Permanent monitor started
[2025-07-18 18:25:54] Killing high-CPU process PID 31642 (CPU: 40.8%)
[2025-07-18 18:25:54] Killing high-CPU process PID 31669 (CPU: 41.4%)
[2025-07-18 18:26:04] Killing high-CPU process PID 32922 (CPU: 112%)
[2025-07-18 18:26:04] Killing high-CPU process PID 32941 (CPU: 93.1%)
```

**Pattern**: New PIDs every 10 seconds, indicating Cursor was constantly restarting killed processes.

## Problematic Scripts

### 1. `aggressive_typing_fix.sh` (CRITICAL ISSUE)
- **Problem**: Too aggressive CPU threshold (5%)
- **Problem**: 5-second monitoring interval (too frequent)
- **Problem**: Killing processes that Cursor needs to function
- **Result**: Created restart/kill loop

### 2. `cursor_permanent_monitor.sh` (CONTRIBUTING FACTOR)
- **Problem**: 10-second monitoring interval
- **Problem**: Killing processes without understanding Cursor's architecture
- **Result**: Contributed to the crash loop

## Safe Alternative: `cursor-safe-optimizer.sh`
This script is much safer because it:
- ✅ Only kills non-critical processes (utility, gpu)
- ✅ Preserves main and renderer processes
- ✅ Uses higher CPU thresholds (15%)
- ✅ Has longer monitoring intervals
- ✅ Includes safety checks

## Recovery Plan

### Immediate Actions (Already Done)
1. ✅ Computer restart cleared the crash loop
2. ✅ No monitoring scripts currently running
3. ✅ Cursor is currently stable

### Recommended Actions
1. **Disable aggressive scripts**: Don't use `aggressive_typing_fix.sh`
2. **Use safe optimizer**: Test `cursor-safe-optimizer.sh` instead
3. **Monitor carefully**: Watch for any performance issues
4. **Backup chats**: Past chats may be lost due to cache clearing

### Safe Performance Optimization
```bash
# Use the safe optimizer instead
./cursor-safe-optimizer.sh

# Or manually check performance
./typing_delay_diagnostic.sh
```

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Script Safety Guidelines
- Never kill processes with CPU < 15%
- Never kill main/renderer processes
- Use monitoring intervals > 30 seconds
- Include safety checks and process type detection

### 2. Monitoring Best Practices
- Monitor for 30+ seconds before taking action
- Log all actions for debugging
- Include process type detection
- Have emergency stop mechanisms

### 3. Testing Protocol
- Test optimization scripts on non-critical projects
- Monitor system stability for 24+ hours
- Have rollback procedures ready

## Current Status
- ✅ Cursor is running stable
- ✅ No aggressive monitoring active
- ✅ Performance logs available for analysis
- ⚠️ Past chat history may be lost
- ⚠️ Need to test safe optimization scripts

## Next Steps
1. Test `cursor-safe-optimizer.sh` carefully
2. Monitor Cursor performance for 24 hours
3. Document any remaining typing delays
4. Consider manual performance tuning instead of automated scripts
