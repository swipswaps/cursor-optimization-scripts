[INFO] 💡 PERFORMANCE RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. 🔄 Restart VS Code completely: code --disable-extensions
2. 🧹 Regular cleanup: Run this script weekly
3. 📊 Monitor with: htop or top
4. 🔧 VS Code settings: Disable heavy extensions temporarily
5. 🐳 MCP server: Use correct Docker stdio mode, not exec
6. 💾 Memory: Consider closing unused applications
7. 🔄 Reboot: If issues persist, restart system
