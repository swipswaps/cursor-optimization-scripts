# Security Policy

## ⚠️ ALPHA SOFTWARE SECURITY NOTICE

**This is ALPHA software that has NOT been security tested or audited.**

### Security Status
- **Version 0.1.0-alpha**: ❌ NOT security tested
- **Production Use**: ❌ NOT recommended
- **Security Audit**: ❌ NOT performed

## Supported Versions

| Version | Security Support | Status |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| 0.1.0-alpha | ❌ No security support | Alpha/Untested |
| Future releases | TBD | Pending testing |

## Known Security Considerations

### System-Level Access
- Script requires Docker installation and management
- Modifies system configuration files
- Creates directories and files with specific permissions
- Executes commands with elevated privileges (sudo)

### Network Access
- Downloads Docker images from external registries
- Communicates with Docker daemon
- May expose MCP server on network interfaces

### File System Access
- Creates temporary files and directories
- Modifies user configuration files
- Accesses system logs and monitoring data

## Security Recommendations

### Before Use
1. **Review the entire script** before execution
2. **Test in isolated environment** first
3. **Backup your system** before running
4. **Verify Docker security** configuration
5. **Check network firewall** settings

### During Use
1. **Monitor system resources** during execution
2. **Watch for unexpected behavior**
3. **Check log files** for anomalies
4. **Verify cleanup completion**

### After Use
1. **Review generated configuration** files
2. **Check system state** for changes
3. **Monitor running processes**
4. **Validate network connections**

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report
- **Email**: Create GitHub issue with "SECURITY" label
- **Response Time**: Best effort (no SLA for alpha software)
- **Disclosure**: Responsible disclosure preferred

### What to Include
1. **Vulnerability description**
2. **Steps to reproduce**
3. **Potential impact assessment**
4. **Suggested mitigation** (if any)
5. **System information** (OS, Docker version, etc.)

### What to Expect
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 7 days (best effort)
- **Assessment**: Security review of reported issue
- **Resolution**: Fix in future release (if applicable)
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure timeline

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Never run as root** unless absolutely necessary
2. **Use dedicated test systems** for evaluation
3. **Monitor system logs** during and after execution
4. **Keep Docker updated** to latest security patches
5. **Review generated configs** before using in production

### For Contributors
1. **Follow secure coding practices**
2. **Validate all user inputs**
3. **Use secure file operations**
4. **Implement proper error handling**
5. **Document security implications**
