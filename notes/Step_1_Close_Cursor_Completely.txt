Step 1: Close Cursor Completely


# Kill all Cursor processes
pkill -f cursor

Step 2: Run the Emergency Fix

# Make the script executable and run it
chmod +x cursor_emergency_terminal_fix.sh
./cursor_emergency_terminal_fix.sh

Step 3: Install Permanent Fix

# Install the permanent system fix
chmod +x cursor_permanent_terminal_fix.sh
./cursor_permanent_terminal_fix.sh

Step 4: Launch Cursor with Terminal Fixes

~/cursor-terminal-fixed.sh

üéØ Why This Will Work
The ptyHost Issue Explained:
ptyHost = Terminal subsystem that handles all terminal operations
Heartbeat failure = Terminal subsystem is completely broken
GPU crash = Terminal rendering fails, causing ptyHost to fail
Apple A1286 = Known GPU compatibility issues with Electron
The Fix:
Disables GPU acceleration completely (prevents crashes)
Uses software rendering (more compatible with older hardware)
Fixes terminal subsystem by preventing GPU-related crashes
Creates permanent solution that persists across reboots
‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:
What to Expect:
‚úÖ Terminal will work (no more ptyHost errors)
‚úÖ No more GPU crashes (exit code 15)
‚úÖ Stable performance (software rendering)
‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly slower graphics (software vs hardware rendering)
Alternative Launch Methods:

# Method 1: Use the fixed launcher
~/cursor-terminal-fixed.sh

# Method 2: Launch with flags directly
cursor --disable-gpu --disable-software-rasterizer --no-sandbox --disable-gpu-process

# Method 3: Use environment variables
export ELECTRON_DISABLE_GPU=1
export ELECTRON_DISABLE_GPU_PROCESS=1
cursor

Yes, close Cursor now and run the fixes. The ptyHost heartbeat failures indicate a critical terminal subsystem failure that needs immediate attention.
